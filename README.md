# ft_linear_regression

A simple linear regression with a single feature - in this case, the mileage of the car

- The first program will be used to predict the price of a car for a given mileage. When you launch the program, it should prompt you for a mileage, and then giveyou back the estimated price for that mileage. The program will use the following hypothesis to predict the price.

- The second program will be used to train your model. It will read your datasetfile and perform a linear regression on the data. Once the linear regression has completed, you will save the variables theta0 and theta1 for use in the first program.
